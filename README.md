# AKI_Seminar_2_Project_Demo


In Seminar 2, our focus will be on a practical demonstration of tuning the LLaMA model developed by Meta AI, as outlined in their paper. The LLaMA model is a cutting-edge technology that leverages advanced machine learning techniques, and our goal is to provide a hands-on experience for understanding its tuning process.
During the demo, we will delve into the key components of the LLaMA model, emphasizing the significance of parameter tuning in optimizing its performance. We'll explore how to adjust hyperparameters, fine-tune model architectures, and optimize training parameters to achieve superior results.
Attendees will have the opportunity to actively engage in the tuning process, providing them with a hands-on understanding of the nuances involved in refining the LLaMA model for various applications.
By the end of the seminar, participants will not only comprehend the theoretical foundations of the LLaMA model but will also possess practical skills to navigate its tuning process, enabling them to apply this knowledge in their own machine learning endeavors.
